# Project -1, Eniacs Expansion to Brazil
## Summary
Eniac is a leading online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, founded in Spain ten years ago. Known for its wide catalog, competitive prices, and exceptional customer support, Eniac has expanded to neighboring countries and recently went public. With investor pressure to scale globally while retaining its customer-centric approach, Eniac is exploring an expansion into the Brazilian market.
This project analyzes the potential expansion of Eniac into Brazil using data provided by Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company that connects small and medium-sized stores with major Brazilian marketplaces. Magist offers services like stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service, which could facilitate Eniac's entry into the market.
## Tools and Technologies Used
SQL: For data extraction and analysis.
Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
## Key Learnings
Data Analysis:
Utilized SQL for querying and analyzing Magist’s database to gather insights on delivery performance and customer satisfaction.
Explored key performance metrics including delivery times, customer feedback, and service efficiency.
Visualization:
Created comprehensive dashboards in Tableau to visualize the data and support decision-making.
Presented findings on delivery speed, cost-effectiveness, and customer satisfaction.
## Challenges Overcame
Learning SQL as a Beginner:
Initial Syntax and Query Construction: Understanding SQL syntax and constructing effective queries was challenging at first. I overcame this by practicing with simple queries and gradually moving to more complex ones.
Database Schema Understanding: Grasping the structure of Magist’s database required learning how to read and interpret ER diagrams and table relationships. Regular consultation with documentation and tutorials helped me gain proficiency.
Debugging Queries: Encountering and resolving errors in SQL queries was a significant learning curve. By using systematic debugging techniques and seeking advice from forums and mentors, I improved my problem-solving skills.
Optimizing Queries: Writing efficient queries to handle large datasets without performance issues was a crucial challenge. Learning about indexing, joins, and query optimization techniques enabled me to handle data more effectively.
## Aditional Reflections
Working on this project as a beginner taught me valuable lessons in teamwork. I learned the importance of clear communication and effective collaboration, appreciating the diverse perspectives of my peers.
